 2. Each battle is best of 3 rounds.
 3. The obligation to make drinks as a result of losing is limited to tea.
    
    _Coffee and other drinks are not part of the game._

## Rechallenging

 1. When a player loses a battle they may challenge someone else who has not yet made a round of tea.
 2. If one loses to three players in a row, one must make tea for the rest of the day.
    
    _This rolls until midnight, not until the end of the business day._
    
 3. The right to rechallenge is lose if the shame rule is in effect.

## Shame Rule

During a challenge, if a player loses 2 rounds in a row at the start of the game one is considered shamed and therefore must immediately make tea and loses the right to rechallenge.
